#DOCUMENTATION

####There are three modules so far. They have some basic stuff in them that's already in C# prolly', I just couldn't find them.


Better Basics has three modules.
* String Parse
  * Contains a few helpful things for streamlined string parsing
* Range
  * Litterally has two functions in it, one has a start stop step, the other starts at 1 and goes till you tell it to stop
* Arrays
  * Since Arrays are non mutable, this module has an array adder.
  * Arrays also has a method to check if a value is contained in an array.
